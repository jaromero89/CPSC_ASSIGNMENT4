It took me rather long to getting a working project . I found it difficult  to bring everything  together . I had a number of issues, but fortunately  this forced me to research and help gain a wealth of knowledge . I was able to get assistance in many ways by fellow students and online resources . I highly debated on working with a partner, but did not fell entirely  comfortable in understanding the assignment and cause time issues.
